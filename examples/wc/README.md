Word Count
==========

This directory contains the implementation of a simple word-count 
utility as a demonstration of persistent gawk.

Evaluation  
----------

First, set GAWK and PMGAWK environment variables to point 
to the GAWK and PM-GAWK binaries, respectively. For example, in bash:

```
export GAWK=<path to gawk binary>
export PMGAWK=<path to pmgawk binary>
```

To run the complete test:

```
test.sh
```
